# Tableau-COVID-19-TRACKER
 

In the last couple of weeks I was working on a case study. The fact that I chose Tennessee(TN) was because in the most affected states like NY the curve has bend and the lockdown played a major role in it.
But in states like TN the number of active cases are still rising up and the day(11th May'20) the lockdown has opened up in TN we see a linear increase in cases though the positive sign is the recovery rate is still high and number of recoveries has overtaken the total active cases.

PS - The major learning from this dashboard was to utilize and play with different containers and tell a story in a more efficient way with the color coding for various numbers and graphs(used advance features like LOD, calculated field,sets etc for calculations).
